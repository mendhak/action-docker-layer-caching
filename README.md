# Docker Layer Caching in GitHub Actions [![Readme Test status is unavailable](https://github.com/jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching/workflows/Readme%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Readme+Test%22) [![CI status is unavailable](https://github.com/jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Enable Docker Layer Caching by adding a single line in GitHub Actions.
This GitHub Action speeds up the building of docker images in your GitHub Actions workflow.

You can run `docker build` and `docker-compose build` in your GitHub Actions workflow using the cache with no special configuration, and it also supports multi-stage builds.

This GitHub Action uses the [docker save](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/) / [docker load](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/) command and the [@actions/cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache) library.

## ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice for `satackey v0.0.11` and older** ⚠️

Both this and the underlying [push-prebuilt-action](https://github.com/jpribyl/push-prebuilt-action) repositories seem to be
abandoned and the old repo is throwing a couple deprecation warnings. v0.1.0
addresses those. Would be happy to add others on as maintainers as well to
avoid a repeat of this scenario.

([#347](https://github.com/satackey/action-docker-layer-caching/issues/347))  
\*\*Please update to version `v0.1.0`

## Example workflows

### Docker Compose

```yaml
name: CI

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Pull the latest image to build, and avoid caching pull-only images.
      # (docker pull is faster than caching in most cases.)
      - run: docker-compose pull

      # In this step, this action saves a list of existing images,
      # the cache is created without them in the post run.
      # It also restores the cache if it exists.
      - uses: jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.1.0
        # Ignore the failure of a step and avoid terminating the job.
        continue-on-error: true

      - run: docker-compose up --build

    # Finally, "Post Run jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.1.0",
    # which is the process of saving the cache, will be executed.
```

### docker build

```yaml
name: CI

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # In this step, this action saves a list of existing images,
      # the cache is created without them in the post run.
      # It also restores the cache if it exists.
      - uses: jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.1.0
        # Ignore the failure of a step and avoid terminating the job.
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Build the Docker image
        run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag my-image-name:$(date +%s)

    # Finally, "Post Run jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.1.0",
    # which is the process of saving the cache, will be executed.
```

## Inputs

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for details.

By default, the cache is separated by the workflow name.
You can also set the cache key manually, like the official [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache#usage) action.

```yaml
- uses: jpribyl/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.1.0
  # Ignore the failure of a step and avoid terminating the job.
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    key: foo-docker-cache-{hash}
    restore-keys: |
      foo-docker-cache-
```

**Note: You must include `{hash}` in the `key` input.** (`{hash}` is replaced by the hash value of the docker image when the action is executed.)
